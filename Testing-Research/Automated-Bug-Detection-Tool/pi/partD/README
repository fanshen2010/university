Assignment 3 Part1(D) description

The main idea of this approach is to consider the order for pipair, while discovering bug by the method of part1(A)
The only difference with Part1(A) is that HashMap 'location' changed from Map<Set,Set> into Map<List,Set>
The Map<List,Set> can help distinguish [A,B] from [B,A], and store pipair with same element such as [A,A]


The running mothod is the same with part1(A)
run the command as below in test folder on eceLinux
1 make
2 cd test3
3 ../pipair test3.bc 3 65


The bug output include:
1 the reduced bug for Part1(A)
2 the new bug for Part1(D)
